# Cellular Automata Model
### Author: Patrick Lavin

The code for the CA model is in the Python Notebook in this directory. At the top of the file, you will find the various simulation parameters. At the bottom, you will find the simulation loop and a histogram of the run times. 

To run the code on PACE, simply do `python run.py`. It will run the simulation for 1000 time steps and output the mean and median travel times. Right now, the time is in ticks, as I have not set time and distances for this simulation.
