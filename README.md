# Project 2: Modeling & Simulation Life Cycle


## SETUP
First, you will need [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com). This
[tutorial](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial) gives you a better
idea of how Git LFS works.

Once that's done, clone the repo as usual and initialize LFS.
```bash
git clone git@github.gatech.edu:msakhi3/modsim_life_cycle.git
git lfs install
```

## ORGANIZATION
Each of the three approaches, (1) Cellular Automata, (2) Event-Driven Queues,
and (3) Activity Scanning Queues have a respective folder in the project root
directory.
